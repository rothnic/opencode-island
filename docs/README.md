## About This Project

This documentation was created to support the migration of Claude Island (a macOS menu bar app for Claude Code CLI sessions) to OpenCode. The goal is to understand OpenCode's advanced capabilities and adapt the project accordingly.

## Contributing

This is a living document. As we explore and implement OpenCode features, this documentation will be updated with new findings and best practices.
